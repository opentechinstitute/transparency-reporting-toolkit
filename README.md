# Transparency Reporting Toolkit
A hub for submitting, standardising and experimenting with transparency report data.

## Prerequisites
- Node
- NPM
- Grunt & Grunt-cli
- PHP
- Git
- Ruby

If you aren't sure whether you have any of the above, in Terminal run `[name of prerequisite] -v` to get the version number (if it's installed).

## Local development
- `npm install` will get you the grunt tasks installed in a node_modules folder
- `gem install sass` will install SASS
- run `grunt` to start a php server (will open browser window pointed at localhost when ready)
- in a separate Terminal window, run `grunt watch` to keep an eye on .hbs, .scss and .js files in your src folder
